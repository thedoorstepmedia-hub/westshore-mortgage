Query the council of AI coding agents to gather diverse perspectives.

## Progress Tracking

Create a task at the start to show progress throughout the query:

```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Query council"
  description: "Querying AI providers for diverse perspectives"
  activeForm: "Preparing council query..."

TaskUpdate: status → in_progress
```

Update `activeForm` as you progress through phases:
- `"Gathering context..."` - during auto-context detection
- `"Querying council providers..."` - during query-council.sh execution
- `"Formatting responses..."` - during format-output.sh execution
- `"Synthesizing recommendations..."` - during synthesis generation

Mark `status → completed` when finished.

## Pre-Query Interaction

Before querying, use AskUserQuestion in these scenarios:

### 1. Provider Selection + Verbosity (if --providers and --verbosity not specified)

First, discover the providers that would be queried by default (post CLI-prefers-API policy — `--list-default` is the right flag here, NOT `--list-available`, which includes shadowed API siblings that won't run by default):
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/query-council.sh --list-default 2>&1 | head -1
```

**Only show default-queried providers in the question.** If only 1 provider is available, skip the provider question and use it directly. If the user wants a shadowed API provider (e.g., `openai` when codex is installed), they can pass `--providers=openai` explicitly.

**The first option of the providers question must be "All providers" (Recommended)** — this is the most common choice and saves the user from clicking each provider individually. If the user picks it, treat it as selecting every available provider.

**Combine providers + verbosity into a single AskUserQuestion call** (it supports multiple questions per call) so the user resolves both decisions in one screen instead of two:

```
Question 1: "Which AI providers should I consult?"
Header: "Providers"
multiSelect: true
Options:
  - All providers (Recommended) - query every configured provider in parallel
  - Gemini (gemini-3.1-pro-preview) - Google's reasoning model
  - OpenAI (gpt-5.5-pro) - OpenAI's reasoning model
  - Grok (grok-4.20-reasoning) - xAI's reasoning model
  - Perplexity (sonar-reasoning-pro) - search-augmented reasoning

Question 2: "How verbose should the responses be?"
Header: "Verbosity"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - Standard (Recommended) - balanced thoroughness
  - Brief - 3-5 sentences, bullets only, no code unless asked
  - Detailed - thorough analysis with code examples and trade-offs
```

When the providers list exceeds 4 options ("All" + N providers), AskUserQuestion's 4-option limit forces a different shape — collapse to "All / Fast subset / Custom" presets.

**Skip the verbosity question if `--verbosity` was passed** explicitly. Skip the providers question if `--providers` was passed. Resolve both via flags when both are present.

Map the verbosity selection to the `--verbosity` flag passed to query-council.sh:
- "Standard" → omit the flag (default)
- "Brief" → `--verbosity=brief`
- "Detailed" → `--verbosity=detailed`

### 2. Clarify Ambiguous Questions

If the question is vague or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask for clarification.

**Skip these interactions if:**
- User provided `--providers` flag
- Question is specific and clear
- Context from conversation already clarifies intent

## Step 1: Auto-Context Detection

Unless `--no-auto-context` or `--file=` is in $ARGUMENTS, detect and include relevant files:

1. Extract keywords from the question (function names, domain terms, file patterns)
2. Search with Glob and Grep for matching files (max 5 files, ~10,000 tokens)
3. If relevant files found, show: `Auto-included context (N files): [list]`
4. Append file contents to the prompt sent to providers

Skip auto-context if:
- `--no-auto-context` is specified
- `--file=` is specified (explicit context)
- Question doesn't reference code concepts

## Step 1.5: Agent Mode Detection

Determine if agent-enhanced mode should be used:

### Explicit trigger
If `--agents` is in $ARGUMENTS, use agent mode.

### Natural language detection
If `--agents` is NOT explicitly set, check if the question suggests a complex analysis.
Look for these signals:

**Architecture/design**: "architecture", "design decision", "tradeoffs", "trade-offs",
"compare approaches", "system design"

**Depth**: "deeply", "thoroughly", "comprehensively", "carefully evaluate",
"in-depth", "detailed analysis"

**Review**: "security review", "audit", "code review", "implications of",
"risk assessment"

**Decision**: "should we use X or Y", "which approach", "what are the risks",
"evaluate the options"

If 2+ signals are present, suggest agent mode:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "This looks like a complex decision. Use agent-enhanced analysis for deeper insights?"
  Header: "Analysis Mode"
  Options:
    - "Yes - deeper analysis with AI subagents (~20s extra)"
    - "No - standard fast mode"
```

If the user selects yes, proceed with agent mode.

**Skip NL detection if:**
- `--agents` was explicitly passed (already enabled)
- Only 1 provider is available (agents add less value with single provider)
- `--quiet` mode is on (user wants fast results)

## Step 2: Execute and Display

### If Agent Mode is Active

**Invoke the `deep-execution` skill** and follow its instructions. The skill handles
spawning subagents, collecting results, displaying analyses, and generating synthesis.

Skip Step 3 (synthesis) - the deep-execution skill generates its own enhanced synthesis.

### If Standard Mode (default)

**CRITICAL - Flag Syntax**: All script flags use `=` with NO spaces:
- CORRECT: `--providers=gemini,openai`
- WRONG: `--providers "gemini,openai"`
- WRONG: `--providers gemini,openai`

**Invoke the `council-execution` skill** and follow its instructions to run the query pipeline and display output.

## Step 3: Generate Synthesis (standard mode only)

After the formatted output, generate synthesis analyzing the provider responses:

1. **Consensus**: Points where providers agree
2. **Divergence**: Where they disagree and why
3. **Unique insights**: Notable points from each provider
4. **Recommendation**: Strongest approach for the situation

### If Debate Mode Was Used

Additionally include:
- **Strongest criticisms**: Most compelling points from rebuttals
- **Consensus shifts**: Where providers changed positions
- **Unresolved tensions**: Remaining disagreements

## Step 4: Export (if --output specified)

If `--output=<path>` was specified:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/export.sh --write "<output_path>" "<prompt>" "<providers>"
```

Confirm: `Exported to: <output_path>`

## Error Handling

- If query-council.sh fails, show the error message
- If some providers fail, note errors but continue with available responses
- If all providers fail, report the failure clearly
